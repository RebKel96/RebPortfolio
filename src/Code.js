    <p> I code so that my designs can truly shine in an interactive environment. I've dabbled in a few different languages through the
        years, such as Java, Python, and C#, but I'm most comfortable with code complimenting front-end website development.
        HTML, CSS, and Javascript have been my main tools on my journey to solidify a career. When creating website applications,
        I have learned to use React, which is the most popular Javascript framework being used currently. I coded this full
        portfolio in React, and I've had a blast doing so!
</p>
<p>Coding know-how is a little more difficult to showcase than general digital media, but this portfolio is a decent example
    of what I've been able to accomplish with React at this point. I'll showcase a couple other applications I've made below.
    if you'd like to see the code, I'll link the Github repo as well.
